# Vanilla+ Personal Mini Repack (S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: COP Edition)

## Based mainly on PRP V1.2 and PartyBoat's Vanilla Twist Concept

This is a proof-of-concept mod, primarily aimed at experimentation and learning about modding. While it seeks to retain the spirit of the original gameplay, it's intended for exploration rather than full implementation.

Also, I'm aiming for unifying key mechanics across the trilogy (SOC, CS, COP) for a consistent experience. Features like closed-cycle suits lacking night vision (inspired by COP) ensure consistency, while drawing on [PartyBoat's Vanilla Twist mod](https://www.moddb.com/mods/stalker-vanilla-twist/downloads/stalker-vanilla-twist-v10) for replayability enhancements like realistic medkit usage.

Tweaking vanilla taught me to respect certain features, like SOC/COP's sound/visibility HUD indicators and the radioactive zone PPE effect. Note: These changes are easily reversible if you prefer the original setup, just be aware reverting changes requires some modding knowledge.

Used addons/mods/code/files plus source + modder (some of them are used only as reference to do or learn things and aren't implemented as such):
