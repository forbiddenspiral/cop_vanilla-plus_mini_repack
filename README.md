# Vanilla+ Personal Mini Repack - S.T.A.L.K.E.R.: COP Edition

## Based mainly on PRP v1.2 + Custom Gameplay Tweaks

This is a personal project I'm working on to experiment with modding and learn the ropes. My goal is to preserve the core gameplay and visuals while introducing subtle tweaks to enhance immersion and replayability.

While this is a small project, I'm aiming to unify certain aspects of gameplay across the trilogy to create a more consistent experience. This includes features like closed-cycle suits lacking night vision (inspired by COP) for a more unified feel. Additionally, I'm borrowing replayability enhancements like realistic medkit and food usage from PartyBoat's Vanilla Twist mod to add a touch of freshness to the familiar gameplay.

Through this project, I've gained a newfound appreciation for certain vanilla features, like SOC/COP's sound/visibility HUD indicators and the radioactive zone PPE effect. It's important to note that many of the changes are easily reversible if you prefer the original experience. However, reverting them requires some modding knowledge, so please proceed with caution.

**General Notes:**

- Core gameplay mechanics like ballistics, damage systems, AI, and player attributes remain unchanged from the vanilla game. Item consumable properties are modified by the Medicine Mod.
- Due to time constraints and limited modding experience. An optional "Alternative Ballistics Core" add-on is planned to potentially port these features directly from SRP in the future.
- Original graphics and visuals are preserved.
- Limited compatibility: supports 16:9 aspect ratio monitors, resolutions up to 1920x1080, and English language (subtitles included).
