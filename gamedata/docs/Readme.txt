Special Thanks:

NatVac for his work in the ZRP elements that I adapted and the Modifier tool.
Shifter for starting the PRP endeveaur and recollecting bugs.
Stalker_93 for releasing the PRP repack on which this one is based.
Jurok for the Unofficial Patch, from which I borrowed some fixes, tweaks and values.
lowenz for providing the elussive fix to stretched skyboxes.
BobBQ for providing english localization files.
RK Roadkill and Mwnn for pointing to issues in the english localization files.
RK Roadkill, notanumber, Mwnn and lowenz for reporting errors and crashes.
InnoClarke for reporting the cause of a CTD when disabling the controller effect with the Modifier.


To Do:

The Modifier configs entries currently lack the help notes that explain in detail what 
the various changes do. I find most changes are pretty straight forward and the tooltips 
in their entries provide sufficient infomration.

I add fixes, tweaks and mods as I find them if they are small or simple. Input is still 
needed on bugs and annoyances and their possible fixes, as well as tweaks that are 
favored by the community.
